== Exercise 1.3 - Installing Ansible Tower

In this exercise, we are going to get Ansible Tower installed on your control node

*Step 1:* ssh into your control node

    ssh <username>@<IP of control node>

*Step 2:* Change directories to /tmp

    cd /tmp

*Step 3:* Download the latest Ansible Tower package

    curl -O http://releases.ansible.com/ansible-tower/setup/ansible-tower-setup-latest.tar.gz

*Step 4:* Untar and unzip the package file

    tar xvfz /tmp/ansible-tower-setup-latest.tar.gz

*Step 5:* Change directories into the ansible tower package

    cd /tmp/ansible-tower-setup-*

*Step 6:* Using an editor of your choice, open the inventory file

    vi inventory

*Step 7:* fill a few variables out in an inventory file: *admin_password, redis_password, pg_password*

    [primary]
    localhost ansible_connection=local

    [secondary]

    [database]

    [all:vars]
    admin_password='ansibleWS'
    redis_password='ansibleWS'

    pg_host=''
    pg_port=''

    pg_database=awx
    pg_username=awx
    pg_password='ansibleWS'

*Step 8:* run the Ansible Tower setup script

    sudo ./setup.sh

Step 8 will take approx. 10-15 minutes to complete. This may be a good time to take a break.

    http://<IP-of-your-control-node>
