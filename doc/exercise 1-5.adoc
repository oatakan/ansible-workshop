Now that you’ve sucessfully creating your Job Template, you are ready to launch it. Once you do, you will be redirected to a job screen which is refreshing in realtime showing you the status of the job.

*Step 1:* Select JOB TEMPLATES

Alternatively, if you haven’t navigated away from the job templates creation page, you can scroll down to see all existing job templates

*Step 4:* Click LAUNCH.

*Step 5:* Sit back, watch the magic happen

One of the first things you will notice is the summary section. This gives you details about your job such as who launched it, what playbook it’s running, what the status is, i.e. pending, running, or complete.
