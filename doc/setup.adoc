== Setup

Today’s workshop infrastructure is being run in Amazon EC2.
Each of you should have received an email when late yesterday. It has the following information on it.

- EC2 username/password
- IP Addresses for each of your EC2 instances
If you didn’t get one of these emails, let us know so we can give you the information about your lab environment.
Workshop Infrastructure

Each student’s personal EC2 lab is equipped with the following:

(1) Control node (to run ansible plays and install Ansible Tower).

(2) Endpoint nodes (to execute ansible playbooks upon).

All three of the aforementioned nodes are running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2

- Ansible Core 2.2
- Ansible Tower 3.0.3

Before we can begin doing super-cool automations and such, we’ve got to get a few basics out of the way. Namely…​ ssh access to your EC2 nodes.

=== Testing your environment

Testing your access:

- Open a terminal or terminal emulator (like PuTTy)
- ssh to each one of your EC2 nodes/instances using ssh.
- ssh <account name>@<IP address of node>

    EXAMPLE: ssh bhirsch@52.62.1.8

Be sure you can log in to your ec2 instances. If you can’t log in start shouting, loudly, and waving your hands!

=== End Result

At this point, everyone should have logged into each of your 3 nodes. If you haven’t, let us know so we can get you fixed up.
