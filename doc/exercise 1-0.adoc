== Exercise 1.0 - Running Ad-hod commands

For our first exercise, we are going to run some ad-hoc commands to help you get a feel for how Ansible works. Ansible Ad-Hoc commands enable you to perform tasks on remote nodes without having to write a playbook. They are very useful when you simply need to do one or two things quickly and often, to many remote nodes.

Like many Linux commands, ansible allows for long-form options as well as short-form. For example:

    ansible web --module-name ping

is the same as running

    ansible web -m ping

We are going to be using the short-form options throughout this workshop.

*Step 1:* Let’s start with something really basic - pinging a host. The ping module makes sure our web hosts are responsive.

    ansible web -m ping

*Step 2:* Now let’s see how we can run a good ol' fashioned Linux command and format the output using the command module.

    ansible web -m command -a "uptime" -o

*Step 3:* Take a look at your web node’s configuration. The setup module displays ansible facts (and a lot of them) about an endpoint.

    ansible web -m setup

*Step 4:* Now, let’s install Apache using the yum module

    ansible web -m yum -a "name=httpd state=present" -b

*Step 5:* OK, Apache is installed now so let’s start it up using the service module

    ansible web -m service -a "name=httpd state=started" -b

*Step 6:* Finally, let’s clean up after ourselves. First, stop the httpd service

    ansible web -m service -a "name=httpd state=stopped" -b

*Step 7:* Next, remove the Apache package

    ansible web -m yum -a "name=httpd state=absent" -b
